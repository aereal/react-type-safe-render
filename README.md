# react-type-safe-render

This repository is monorepo and consists of these packages:

- [react-type-safe-render][]: Provides `safeRender` function that is more type-safe version of `ReactDOM.render` with no additional implementations
- [eslint-config-react-type-safe-render][]: ESLint config that forces using `safeRender` instead of unsafe `ReactDOM.render`

See each package's README for details.

[eslint-config-react-type-safe-render]: ./packages/@aereal/eslint-config-react-type-safe-render
